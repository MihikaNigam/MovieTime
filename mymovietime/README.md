# mymovietime

a simple aesthetic app to add/edit/delete/list movies that a user has watched

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few fetaures:

- has an infinite scrollable listview containing all the movies that a user has created.
- has a form to add a new movie or edit an existing one
- Each list item has a delete icon to remove that movie from the list and an edit icon to allow edit on that movie
- data is stored locally in sqflite local database

integrating persistent google authentication using firebase and then allowing only logged-in users to add movies
